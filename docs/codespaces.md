# Codespaces

[Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is a GitHub service that provides cloud-based development environments. With Codespaces, you can work on this project without any manual setup on your side.

Codespaces is a premium feature of GitHub, see the [pricing calculator](https://github.com/pricing/calculator).
GitHub offers __60 hours every month for free__ for a 2-core instance per user. 

## Create a new codespace

1. Go to the [main-website](https://github.com/ictunion/main-website) repository and fid the `<> Code` button in the upper-right corner.
2. Click the `<> Code` button, a menu will pop up.
3. Go to the `Codespaces` tab and click `Create codespace on main`.
4. A new window with your codespace will open.

> **_NOTE:_** Make sure to [stop](#stop-a-codespace) your Codespace instance once you're done working.__

## Run the website server in a codespace

`cs-start` is a script in the root of the repository for starting the `main-website` server. The script configures `hugo` in a way that allows you to use preview features while working in a codespace.

1. Run the script from your codespace terminal:
    ```
    ./cs-start
    ```

2. Go to `PORTS` and click the link to open a preview of the website.
