title: Why a sectoral union?
---
For the workers in this sector, it makes sense, because this arrangement can cover employees hired with unconventional employment relationships (such as self-employment, freelancing, gig.economy and others) and cover the high mobility rate of workers between companies which is typical for our sector. So, even if you may change your employer, you can still be a member of the same union.
