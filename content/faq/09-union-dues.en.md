title: Why should I pay union dues and where does this money go?
---
The union dues are what makes the union independent and sustainable - from the union dues we pay things such as leaflets for collective actions or organizing of union events to raise awareness, gain more members, and create change. We make all the decisions about the money collectively.

The union dues are collected by the elected treasurer of the union. There is also a controler who verifies the treasurers actions every year and provides a report on the incomes and spendings.There is full transparency when it comes to spending and the board meetings where updates on the union fund are shared is open to any member who wants to listen in or participate in the discussion.
