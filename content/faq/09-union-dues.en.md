title: Why should I pay union dues and where does this money go?
---
**The union dues are what makes the union independent and sustainable.**
We use the union dues to fund things such as leaflets for collective actions or organizing union events aimed at raising awareness,
recruiting new members, and creating change. **We make all the decisions about the the allocation of these funds collectively.**

Our elected **treasurer** is responsible for collecting union dues. An **auditor** reviews the treasurer's actions annualy and provides a report on our income and spending.
**There is full transparency when it comes to spending**. Additionally, the board meetings, where updates on the union fund are shared, are open to any member who wants to listen to or participate in the discussions.
