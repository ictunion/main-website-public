title: What are goals of union?
---
Our goals are:

- connect all workers in our sector and create community,
- protect our economic, professional, social and physical rights,
- achieve better working conditions (better pay, better work hours, ...),
- fight any form of oppression.

We are also cooperating with other organizations aiming for social changes (for example cooperation with climate justice organizations)
We have also joined OSPPP to be better connected to other trade unions.
