title: What are the goals of the union?
---
We want to **connect all workers in our sector and create a community that advocates for our economic, professional, social, and physical rights, improves working conditions, and fights against any form of oppression in the workplace**.

We also strive to **collaborate with other organizations** in the pursuit of social change (for example, working with organizations that advocate for climate justice).

To be a part of labor structures, we have **joined the Union of Banking and Insurance Workers - OSPPP**.
