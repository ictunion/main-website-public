title: Why is there a need for a union in our sector?
---
Because it is necessary to **improve working conditions throughout the whole sector** and we want to be a part of this change.
Our sector is new, rapidly growing, versatile, and uses non-standard types of cooperation, thus benefiting from outsourcing and cheap labor.
The high mobility in the sector does not only concern Czech workers, we also have a large influx of workers from abroad.
These workers are easier to exploit due to language barriers, differences in corporate culture, and labor law.
