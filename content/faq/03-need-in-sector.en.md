title: Why is there a need for a union in our sector?
---
Basically, **there is a need to improve the working conditions in the whole ICT sector** and we want to be part of that change. Our sector is new, rapidly growing, and versatile and utilizes non-standard contracts and unconventional employment relationships and therefore **profits from outsourcing and cheap labor.** The high mobility rate of employees does not only concern Czech people but also we have **a large incoming flow of foreign employees.** Those are **easier to be taken advantage of due to the language barrier and differences in corporate culture and the Labor code.**
