title: Why is there a need for a union in our sector?
---
Our sector is new, rapidly growing, and versatile (companies of all shapes and sizes, from small startups to big international corporations) and utilizes non-standard contracts and unconventional employment relationships (freelancing/internships and others) and therefore profits from outsourcing and cheap labor. It is moreover a sector with a high mobility rate of employees, not only between companies inside the Czech Republic but also with a large incoming flow of foreign employees, who are easier to be taken advantage of due to the language barrier and differences in corporate culture and the Labor code. Basically, there is a need to improve the working conditions in the ICT sector as well, and we want to be part of that change.
