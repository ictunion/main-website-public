title: How much time should I dedicate to the union?
---
A union is only as strong as the number if it's members, most importantly it's active members. We are a young union with a lot of ideas on how to make ourselves and our environment better and our desire is to have as many members involved in the decision making and the co-creation of actions as possible.

But of course, it is also more than okay to attend our online members meetings once a month or become a passive member and support us in our efforts.
