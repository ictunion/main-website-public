title: How much time should I dedicate to the union?
---
Unions are only as strong as the number of their members, especially those who are active.

We are a young organization with many ideas on how to improve our sector,
and we would like as many members as possible to participate in decision-making and event planning.

**Of course, it's perfectly okay to just attend our regular monthly online meetings or even be a passive member.**
