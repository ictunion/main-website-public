title: What is a sectoral union?
---

A sectoral union is a trade union of workers that are employed in a specific sector of the economy. It is a union that is not only for and from workers of a specific company. With the sectoral union freelancers and workers from different companies, positions, and professions within the sector organize as a collective to have a say in all matters that involve them in the workplace. The ICT sector stands for Information and Communication technology and includes IT and customer care, meaning anyone from testers, programmers, to call center and back office workers and many more.
