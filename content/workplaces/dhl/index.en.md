### About the DHL ITS Prague Workers Union
The DHL ITS Prague Workers Union is a collective that represents all employees of DHL ITS in the Czech Republic. Operating under the ICT Union, we aim to uphold DHL’s values while advocating for the rights and well-being of all workers.

We are part of the ICT/Information and Communication Technology sectoral union, which is a member of the OSPPP (Trade Union Federation of Finance and Insurance Workers). For more information, please visit the [ICT FAQ]({{< relref "faq" >}}).

The DHL ITS Prague Workers Union is independent of the employer and is formed and managed by the workers themselves. We established the union to protect our collective interests and rights. We believe this is a crucial step to improve our working conditions, safeguard our benefits, and ensure our voices are heard in decision-making processes.
