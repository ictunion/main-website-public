We, Microsoft Workers Union, are a collective representing all workers of Microsoft in the Czech Republic. Our workers union operates within the ICT Union, aiming to uphold the values and mission of Microsoft while advocating for the rights and well-being of all employees. 

Microsoft Workers Union is formed and managed by the workers and is independent of the employer.

### Mission and Vision
We advocate for job security, safeguarding existing benefits, and actively participating in decision-making processes to create a more inclusive and supportive workplace. 

In alignment with Microsoft's corporate motto, "Our mission is to empower every person and every organisation on the planet to achieve more," our mission is to represent the voice of Microsoft workers in the Czech Republic. Unionization provides a vital platform for all workers to voice their concerns, contribute their perspectives, and actively shape decisions that contribute to the continued success and growth of our company.

### Becoming a Member
It's a simple process that allows individuals to join our collective effort. Apply for the ICT Union [membership here]({{< relref "register" >}}). Once you are a member of the ICT Union and work for Microsoft, you become a member of the Microsoft Workers Union. 

### Membership Fees
A monthly fee is 1% of your monthly salary, but up to 300 CZK. If you wish to support the unionising efforts further, you can contribute a solidarity fee of up to 600 CZK.

Microsoft Workers Union operates under the ICT Union. Even though you pay your fee to the ICT Union, it is used for the benefit of the Microsoft Workers Union’s members. The fee is allocated: 
- 20% allocated to Trade Union Federation of Finance and Insurance Workers (OS PPP - Odborový svaz pracovníků peněžnictví a pojišťovnictví), 
- 40% directed towards the ICT Union budget, 
- 40% directly utilised by the Microsoft Workers Union for member benefits and initiatives.

### How Your Fee Is Utilized
The Microsoft Workers Union makes independent decisions about the use of membership fees. These funds are used for promoting the workers union, holding members’ meetings, and other costs associated with the independent operation of the organisation.

ICT Union funds contribute to organising workshops, training sessions, and meetings accessible to all ICT Union members. Additionally, resources are used to support other workplaces, fostering a stronger workers union presence in the sector of Information and Communication Technology. Transparent fund management is ensured to maintain trust and accountability. See the [ICT Union FAQ]({{< relref "faq" >}}).

OS PPP provides us with legal and other support. See [OS PPP website here](https://www.osppp.cz/) (only in Czech).

### Voluntary and Confidential Membership
Membership status is kept confidential and undisclosed to your employer or other members.

Membership is voluntary, providing you with the freedom to join or leave at any time. To cancel your membership, simply notify us at [microsoft@ictunion.cz](mailto:microsoft@ictunion.cz) or cease payment of your membership fee.

### Workers Union Representatives and Member Engagement
The Workplace Executive Committee Microsoft, consisting of elected representatives, serves as the primary liaison between the workers and the company. They facilitate communication, organise meetings, onboard new members, and form the negotiation team.

To ensure all members have a voice, we organise regular monthly members' meetings. These gatherings provide opportunities for members to express their views, share insights, and contribute to the collective decision-making process. 

Every worker's voice and input are crucial to us. By joining the Microsoft Workers Union, you help us represent the majority of voices in discussions and negotiations concerning working conditions in Microsoft.
