## Your voice. Your rights. Your workplace.
At Infosys, we believe that a strong workplace is built on respect, transparency, and the active involvement of those who make the company run every day—its employees. There is a purpose in representing employees’ interests and ensuring they have a strong, constructive voice in shaping their working conditions. 

That’s why we’ve come together to establish the Infosys Workers Union, a platform for open dialogue, shared responsibility, and real impact. Our mission is to advocate for fair compensation, equal opportunities, and a safe, respectful work environment for all employees. 

We wish to see a strong and supportive company culture where people feel valued, heard, and empowered to grow. A company where the employees feel fulfilled and want to build a future. Whether you’re concerned about job security, unclear procedures, or simply want a say in decisions that affect your daily work life, you’re not alone. Our union gives you a seat at the table, backed by the legal and organizational strength of the ICT Union.
