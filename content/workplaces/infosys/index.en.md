## Your voice. Your rights. Your workplace.
At Infosys, we believe that a strong workplace is built on respect, transparency, and the active involvement of those who make the company run every day—its employees. That’s why we’ve come together to establish the Infosys Workers Union, a platform for open dialogue, shared responsibility, and real impact.
Our goal is social peace made possible by your voice and actions.
Whether you're concerned about job security, unclear procedures, or simply want a say in decisions that affect your daily work life, you’re not alone. Our union gives you a seat at the table, backed by the legal and organizational strength of the ICT Union.

## What We Stand For

#### Protection & Support

Workplace issues can be complex, stressful, and difficult to handle alone. As a union member, you’ll have access to **legal advice, professional guidance**, and **support** when it matters most—whether you’re facing layoffs, performance disputes, or unclear changes in company policy.

#### Fair Conditions

We advocate for clear, fair, and sustainable working conditions—because everyone deserves a work environment that respects their time, energy, and contribution. Through **collective bargaining**, we aim to improve transparency, ensure reasonable workloads, and maintain the benefits we’ve earned.

#### Community & Solidarity

Joining the union means joining a community of colleagues who care. We’re building a culture of **mutual respect, shared knowledge**, and **everyday solidarity**—not just during crises, but in the small, ongoing ways we support one another.

#### Knowledge & Confidence

Knowing your rights makes a difference. Through workshops, internal resources, and access to labor experts, we’ll help you understand your protections under the Czech Labor Code and how to make them work for you. It’s not only about knowing your rights, but also knowing how to ask for them.

## Join Us

You can apply online through the [ICT Union application form]({{< relref path="register" >}})

#### Membership Fees
The membership fee is **1% of your monthly gross salary**, capped at **300 CZK.**

The Infosys Workers Union independently manages its own membership fees. These contributions are key to staying self-sufficient and are used to support union operations, organize internal meetings and events, and help grow the local union presence at Infosys.

Funds are managed transparently to ensure trust and accountability. Learn more in the [ICT Union FAQ]({{< relref path="faq#09-union-dues" >}}).

We also receive legal and professional support from **OSPPP** (Trade Federation of Workers in Banking and Insurance), which provides experienced backing in negotiations, labor law, and dispute resolution. More about OSPPP can be found [here (in Czech)](https://www.osppp.cz/poradenstvi).

#### Voluntary and Confidential Membership

Joining the union is **voluntary**, and you are free to **leave at any time**. Membership is fully **confidential**—your employer will not be informed, and your status won’t be shared with other employees without your consent.

To resign, simply notify your representative or stop paying your fee. No justification or formal process is required.

#### Union Representatives & Member Engagement

The union is represented by the **Workplace Executive Committee**, composed of elected Infosys employees. These representatives:

* Serve as the main communication channel between the union and company leadership
* Organize regular union meetings and events
* Welcome and onboard new members
* Lead negotiations and represent employee interests in key workplace matters

All members are encouraged to participate in discussions, share ideas, and vote on important decisions. Our meetings are open spaces for collective dialogue and democratic input.

Every member's voice makes a difference. By joining the union, you contribute to a stronger, more united employee community—one that stands up for fairness, respect, and clear communication.
