Red Hat Czech Workers Union is a collective of Red Hat employees in the Czech Republic. We have formed a workers union to represent our collective interests and rights. We believe that this is an urgent and necessary step to improve our working conditions, protect our benefits, and to have a voice in a transparent decision-making process.

## Mission statement

Our mission is to represent the collective voice of the workers of Red Hat in the Czech Republic and to advocate for our rights, improving our conditions, and advancing our interests.

* We believe that Red Hat can be an even better place to work and unionizing is the best platform for workers to voice their concerns, share their perspectives, and influence decisions that often lack transparency.
* We seek to establish a democratic and transparent relationship with the upper management and their representatives, based on mutual respect, fairness, and cooperation.
* We strive to create a workplace that is safe, healthy, productive, and rewarding for all of us.
* We strive to create a workplace where our voices are heard, our concerns addressed, and our collective well-being remains a top priority.
* We are committed to solidarity, diversity, inclusivity and fostering a culture of transparency, fairness, and accountability in the company.
* We believe that every employee deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, and we will work tirelessly to ensure that our members receive the compensation, benefits, and working conditions they deserve.
* We acknowledge that there have been instances where corporate leadership may not have fully upheld these values and we are committed to fostering accountability through our collective actions.

We are the Red Hat Czech Workers Union, and we are stronger together.
