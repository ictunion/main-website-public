Red Hat Czech Workers Union is a collective of Red Hat employees in the Czech Republic. We have formed a workers' union to represent our collective interests and rights. We believe this is an urgent and necessary step to improve our working conditions, protect our benefits, and have a voice in a transparent decision-making process.

## Mission statement

Our mission is to represent the collective voice of the workers of Red Hat in the Czech Republic and to advocate for our rights, improve our conditions, and advance our interests.

* We believe that Red Hat can be an even better place to work, and unionizing is the best platform for workers to voice their concerns, share their perspectives, and influence decisions that often lack transparency.
* We seek to establish a democratic and transparent relationship with the upper management and their representatives based on mutual respect, fairness, and cooperation.
* We strive to create a safe, healthy, productive, and rewarding workplace for all of us.
* We strive to create a workplace where our voices are heard, our concerns addressed, and our collective well-being remains a top priority.
* We are committed to solidarity, diversity, inclusivity, and fostering a culture of transparency, fairness, and accountability in the company.
* We believe every employee deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, and we will work tirelessly to ensure that our members receive the compensation, benefits, and working conditions they deserve.
* We acknowledge that there have been instances where corporate leadership may not have fully upheld these values, and we are committed to fostering accountability through our collective actions.

We are the Red Hat Czech Workers Union, and we are stronger together.

## FAQ

#### What are the benefits of joining the union? What do unions do?

* A union negotiates working conditions in the company through collective bargaining agreements (CBAs). CBAs can cover anything from compensation to benefits like retirement plans, paid leaves, sick days, etc.
* Union members collectively decide the contents of the CBA. Becoming a member means you will decide what Red Hat's working conditions are like.
* Members have access to the services of a labor lawyer working with the ICT Union, and can also attend workshops and trainings organized by the ICT Union.
