Are you worried about the impact of AI on your job security? Are you having a hard time keeping up with ever-growing expenses? Are you angry at your company for slowly eroding your benefits? Are you feeling increasingly hopeless in a world sliding towards fascism? Do you want to drink beer and talk about Linux?

Come talk to us! We are a union for all workers in the ICT sector in Czech Republic. Whether you are an employee in one of the eight companies where we are already organising, a (slightly ICT adjacent) person curious about unions, searching for like minded and equally frustrated people, or just looking to have some tintilating conversations about all of the above, you are invited to our next public union drink! It is the perfect opportunity for you to come meet union members and organisers, ask all your questions and sate your curiosities. 

It will be **Friday 16 May at 19h** in [Vegalité](https://vegalite.cz/#kontakty) (Slovákova 10, Brno 602 00).
