As workers in the sector of IT and communication, we are and will be affected by the changes in and implementation of AI. As a sectoral union in this sector, we believe it is important to talk about these changes and think about how they affect us, our working conditions, and the future of the sector.
That is why we are meeting in a pub in Brno, on Tuesday the 8th of August at 7 pm to learn and discuss together.
Join us by coming and finding us in the Vegalité saloon.
