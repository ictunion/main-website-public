**Invitation: Introduction to Unions in IT – an open online meeting**

We are excited to share an **invitation to our upcoming online event “Introduction to Unions”** organized by the ICT Union. This event is intended for any ICT sector worker interested in learning more about the unions in Czech Republic and their impact on workers’ lives and jobs. 

**Why to join?** Knowledge is power. We in the ICT Union believe that every worker should have access to essential information that not only protects their rights but also enhances their job security. At this event, we aim to shed light on the significance of unions in the workplace. Topics include understanding unions, their role in safeguarding working conditions, workplace rights, and negotiation strategies with employers.
