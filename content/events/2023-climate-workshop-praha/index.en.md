Will data centres be the new coal mines? Workshop on the ICT sector and the climate crisis for those working in this sector.

We want to address the impact of the ICT sector on the climate crisis but we don't want just technocratic solutions!

The climate crisis is and will be an integral part of our lives and collectively we want to find ways to mitigate the impact of our ICT sector (ICT = IT and communications) on our climate.

We realise that this will not be easy and that we have more questions than answers so far. However, collective solutions must be sought together and that is why we want to meet for a workshop on the climate crisis and the ICT sector. It is important for us to think together as workers who spend a large part of our lives working in IT and communications about what our companies and our sector should do to be sustainable in the future.

We don't expect any one of us to come up with a revolutionary solution, there is no need to prepare in advance, just come with an open mind and a willingness to discuss.

#### How will it work?

We will meet together for an hour and a half, get acquainted, hear data on the impact of the ICT sector on the climate crisis and possible solutions from an expert, and then discuss first in small groups and then together. If there is a lot of interest, we would like to continue the discussions in the coming months.
