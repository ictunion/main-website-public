Like all other sectors, the ICT sector is both affected by and contributing to the climate crisis. The climate crisis is starting to affect our working conditions directly and indirectly, and we think it is important to think about what should be happening in our sector to mitigate the impact of ICT on the climate crisis.

There is no easy answer to this question. Yet, over the past year, in addition to working conditions, we have focused on it as well. As workers in the sector, we have met several times to discuss what a more sustainable form of work might look like in terms of the climate crisis.

The result of our discussions is a short brochure called "Will data centers be the new coal mines?" which you can [download and read](./data/climate_brochure_2023_web.pdf).
