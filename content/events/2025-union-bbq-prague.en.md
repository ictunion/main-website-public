The gathering will take place **Wednesday 18. June from 5 PM (17:00)** in [Containall](https://www.containall.cz/)

Come at any time for a little bit(e) and a casual chat about union organizing. Are you thinking about union membership? Do you want to know a bit about how we work and some of our small victories? Are you a group of colleagues who are ready to organize your workplaces, but you don't know the next steps and best practices? Or are you one of the many recent joiners, but you don't know how to get engaged with the union or what benefits union membership can offer?

All of the above are great reasons to stop by for a meat-vegan-vegetarian feast organized by the ICT Worker Union. If you feel like it, bring a side as a potluck item, but its not a must. Beer and refreshments can be bought at the stand.

We've got a ping pong table reserved, and if beach volleyball will be free, then we could potentially have that available. We hope for beautiful weather, but with the recent changeable weather we are ready for a plan B.
