Workers deserve the right to decide where they work — whether in the office or remotely. **Remote work is not a benefit, but a legitimate form of work.**


#### We, the workers of the ICT sector, understand our needs and working styles better than anyone.

We believe that:

* Remote work is not a luxury, but a valid choice for productive, meaningful employment.
* We should have the right to choose between office work and remote work based on what suits us best.
* Trust between workers and employers is essential. Constant supervision is harmful to productive environments and provides merely an illusion of efficiency.


#### Therefore, we call on employers in the ICT sector to:

1. Respect workers' autonomy and give them the freedom to choose their preferred working environment.
2. Trust their workers and refrain from enforcing unnecessary office attendance.
3. Recognise that flexibility leads to better outcomes for both workers and companies.

If you believe that we, the workers of the ICT sector, should have the right to choose our work environment, please sign and share this petition!

Every signature remains anonymous. Once we reach 1,000 signatures, we will send our demands to the ABSL (Association of Business Service Leaders) and large IT companies that set the market conditions, such as Microsoft, Red Hat, IBM, Infosys, Accenture and Gen Digital. Let’s move the ICT sector forward, together!
