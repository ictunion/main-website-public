We disagree with new proposal, that would allow employers to terminate employees without cause. This proposal has been made by National economic council (NERV) at January 2024.

There is enough options for termination in current czech labor code. Adding termination without cause would open to door to firing people for personal reasons, political opinions, union membership, ethnicity, etc. That would lead to even more fear at workplaces and to weaker position of employees. We should prevent this.

If you are against termination without cause, [sign the petition](https://gov.cz/e-petice/614-petice-proti-propousteni-bez-udani-duvodu) or write to info@ictunion.cz and ask for physical copy to sign.
