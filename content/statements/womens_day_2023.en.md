The international women's day is here and already our companies are sending out emails for
fun competitions and company parties, giving out flowers and chocolate to the female
employees.

But we do not see this day, that has its roots actually with the strike of American garment
female workers, as a celebration but as an opportunity to contemplate on the women's actual
standing in the workplace.

Yes, there have been improvements due to the efforts of workers and institutions in the EU
setting and individual countries. But we still have a long way to go, in order to achieve the
working conditions women deserve in the ICT sector, in all CZ, in Europe, in the world.
So that every day can be women's day!

Here are some suggestions for governmental institutions and for our companies:

- Take serious action on reducing the gender pay gap. Although the situation is getting
gradually better, according to the latest statistics of the EU commission from
November 2022, the gender pay gap is still at 13%.
- Follow the directives of the EU for transparency of pay.
- Be able to provide to the workers, when enquired, data on the pay gap, and
improvement solutions if applicable.
- Do not make employees sign illegal NDAs and do not give instructions to not talk
about our salaries.
- Follow Spain's example and establish menstrual leave of absence for every woman
that needs it.

What can we do as workers to push for change?

- Push our companies to enforce the new EU directives on the transparency of pay.
- Talk openly about our salaries and refuse to sign NDAs concerning that matter.
- Organize in our workplaces so that we can together with all our coworkers demand
contracts regulated by collective agreements.

This is a call to action for all ICT workers, who want a fair working conditions for themselves
and others.
