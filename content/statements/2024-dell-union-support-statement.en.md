The Slovak branch of the American company Dell, Dell Technologies Slovakia, systematically suppresses the activities of the trade union Technologies Unions Slovakia and illegally fired the chairman of this organization, Daniel Andrášek. Other members of the union's board have also had their jobs eliminated, and to a much greater extent than other employees of the company. The chairman of the trade union was fired despite the fact that the trade union, the European Works Council and the Slovak Labour Office expressed their disapproval.

It is unacceptable for any company to suppress the right to organise and bargain collectively over working conditions and to trample on the Labour Code.

We support all members of Technologies Unions Slovakia in their fight for fair treatment by Dell Technologies Slovakia. At the same time, in accordance with the demands in the [petition](https://www.peticie.com/verejna_vyzva_na_dodriavanie_zakonnika_prace_vo_firme_dell_sro), we call on Dell Technologies Slovakia to withdraw the terminations of all members of the union's board, to respect the Labour Code and to stop intimidating the union members.

If you agree that such behaviour is unacceptable, please sign the [petition](https://www.peticie.com/verejna_vyzva_na_dodriavanie_zakonnika_prace_vo_firme_dell_sro) of Technologies Unions Slovakia.
