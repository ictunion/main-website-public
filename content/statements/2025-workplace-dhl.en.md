We are delighted to announce that our union movement has grown with new members at another workplace!

**Employees of DHL ITS have joined the ICT unions**, strengthening our collective effort to improve working conditions in the IT sector. This step further demonstrates the growing solidarity among workers in the field and their determination to actively and jointly defend their rights.

### Together for Better Working Conditions

We welcome our new colleagues and look forward to working together to promote greater fairness, transparency, and equitable treatment in the workplace.

As DHL employees themselves stated in their declaration:
> “Unions in the IT sector are a safeguard against discrimination in an industry characterized by unbalanced working hours and constant change. They empower the people who build the digital world and ensure they are not just tools for profit but voices that must be heard.”

The union organization is represented by a democratically elected committee composed of employees from various departments of the company. Social dialogue with the employer has already been initiated—it takes the form of regular monthly meetings with the company’s management. The elected representatives and members from DHL ITS in Prague recognize that establishing social dialogue is only the beginning, and we will continue to monitor and support their next steps.

### Want to Get Involved or Learn More?
