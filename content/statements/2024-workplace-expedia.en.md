We are very happy to announce that the ICT union is present in a new workplace and with this statement we are welcoming our colleagues from Expedia Services. We are looking forward to improving our working conditions together. We believe that a union can make Expedia an even better place for work.

> “Workers from Expedia are very motivated to get fair treatment from their company. Recent layoffs left a bitter taste in their mouths, but they are standing together and supporting each other in these challenging times.” said one of the organizers working closely with Expedia workers.
