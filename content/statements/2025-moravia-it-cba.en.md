The trade union at **Moravia IT**, which was recently acquired by british **RWS Group**, has announced a major success in collective bargaining. Thanks to intensive negotiations, a collective agreement was finalized in February 2025, introducing significant benefits for employees. It is also the first collective agreement signed in one of the workplaces associated under the Czech Trade union of workers in ICT.

> *“I was pleasantly surprised that we secured a collective agreement so quickly. I didn’t expect it to happen in such a short time.”* says Veronika, a union member

## Key benefits of the collective agreement

The newly signed collective agreement is a crucial step for all employees at **Moravia IT**. It ensures:

- A more stable and fair workplace
- Stronger protection of employee rights
- Clear guidelines for cooperation between management and staff
- Additional benefits beyond legal requirements
- A structured process for regular dialogue between leadership and employees

> *“I believe that as more colleagues join the union, we’ll be able to negotiate even better benefits and improved working conditions. I’m definitely going to talk to my coworkers about this.”* added Veronika.

## Path to success

The trade union was established in **October 2023** and has since worked systematically to improve working conditions for employees at **Moravia IT**. The negotiation team dedicated significant effort to preparing and finalizing the collective agreement, which now delivers tangible benefits for all staff.

> *“We are proud of what we’ve achieved in these negotiations. Our goal is to continuously improve working conditions and contribute to a positive company environment.”* said Luboš Andrlík, union’s chairman.


The Czech **ICT sector** is undergoing an interesting shift. With support from **UNI Global Union**, employee organizations are now active at **six workplaces**, helping workers negotiate collective agreements and join established unions under the **Banking and Insurance Workers Trade Federeation**.

The success of **Moravia IT** demonstrates how quickly employees can organize and find common ground. It proves that when workers unite, they can negotiate mutually beneficial terms with management.
