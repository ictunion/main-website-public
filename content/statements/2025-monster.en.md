In the summer of 2025, due to the insolvency of its US mother company, Monster Worldwide CZ s.r.o experienced changes which led to uncertainty about its future existence in the Czech republic. Employees, both in the Czech republic, as well as in other European countries, faced the risk of losing their work contracts without any certainty of getting their final wages and lawful severances paid out.

The MonsterCareers CZ trade union held a series of meetings aimed at informing employees about possible next steps relating to the insolvency, including the usage of the state guarantee fund, the ability to remain an employee until the final court ruling, as well as the option of immediate work contract termination in accordance with the labor code. The employees were appreciative of our meetings and the actions of ICT Union, all of which were consulted with both union lawyers and representatives of the union.

Negotiations with minority owner Randstad were difficult on account of their limited willingness to offer accountable solutions, as Randstad shifted accountability to the American Apollo company.          

In the Czech republic, in August of 2025, we managed to negotiate additional financing from the US, which enabled the termination of work contracts based on agreement. The majority of employees accepted this offer, which led to a rapid settlement of any legal claims without the need of state support. 

The actions of the MonsterCareers CZ trade union during this crisis were based on providing factual information to employees, legal consultations, cooperation with other trade unions, as well as transparent communication.
