We are excited to welcome our colleagues from Infosys in our ICT union. We are looking forward to making our working conditions better together. Union in the workplace is always beneficial for the workers and we believe that Infosys union will be a great example of this.

> â€œWe have worked on establishing our union for a long time and we are very happy that it finally happened. There will of course be challenges in the future, but we have a great team of dedicated workers and we are ready for action" said one of the Infosys union representatives.
