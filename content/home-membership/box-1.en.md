We are, and we want to be, an active trade union, committed to organizing sector-wide events that help workers learn about important issues and create positive change.

In addition, we support the formation of workplace organizations through sectoral unions.
By uniting at the workplace level, we can negotiate better working conditions and make a difference for everyone.
