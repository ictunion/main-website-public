We believe in continuous learning and seek guidance from union lawyers,
fellow members, and other trade unions and associations to deepen our understanding
of labor law and our rights within the ICT sector and the workplace.

This collaborative approach enables us to be effective advocates for our interests and protect the fundamental rights of
workers in the ever-evolving ICT industry.
