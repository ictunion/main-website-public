    We are group of workers from call centers and IT sector (ICT sector) in Czech Republic. We are meeting together to discuss our working conditions, think about ways to improve them and support each other in doing so.

    We are sectoral union which means that we are not present at only one single workplace. We are instead connecting all workers from ICT sector as individuals and also as whole workplaces. Our members are anyone from testers, programmers, to call center and back office workers and many more.

## What we do?

Our goals are:

- connect all workers in our sector and create community,
- protect our economic, professional, social and physical rights,
- achieve better working conditions (better pay, better work hours, ...),
- fight any form of oppression.

We are also cooperating with other organizations aiming for social changes (for example cooperation with climate justice organizations)
We have also joined OSPPP to be better connected to other trade unions.

## How are we working?

We are active trade union and we have online meeting each month in czech and english language, where we are planning our next actions and make collective decisions. We have one big in person planning meeting every six months. And we also have meetings and events both in person and online. You can be part of this as union member.

## How we started?

ICT Union has been created in summer 2021 in order to connect call center workers and IT workers in Czech Republic and give us common platform. Main reason was situation around working conditions during Covid-19 pandemic. Our first collective action was petition about home office.
