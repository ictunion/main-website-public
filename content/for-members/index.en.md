# Keycloak

Most of the union services are protected by Keycloak. Every union member has [Keycloak](https://keycloak.ictunion.cz/) account created automatically.

Username is your email, that you have used in your union application. Password has to be setup by using “Reset password” function.

Some of our services need 2FA. To make it work you'll need to download “FreeOTP” app from Play Store or Apple Store and connect your Keycloak account.
